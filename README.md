# `scantensus-sdy`

## Installing

## Running The Gradio App
 1. Install Python on your machine. If you're on Windows, use [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/), if you're on MacOS use [this](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python).
 2. Create a virtual environment for the application using `python3 -m venv .sdy-env`
 3. Activate the virtual environment using `source .sdy-env/bin/activate`
 4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of this repository.
 5. Run the application using `python -m app.app`

After the first time (or after I've updated the requirements), you can skip steps 1, 2 and 4 and just run the application using `python -m app.app` in the root directory of this repository. Make sure, however, to ALWAYS be on the virtual environment when running the application (use `source .sdy-env/bin/activate` if not on it).
